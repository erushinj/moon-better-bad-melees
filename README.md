# Better Bad Melees

A Payday 2 mod that makes improvements to melees which Overkill won't do themselves

## Changes

- Many melees are given the stats of a meta melee like the katana

## Notes

- This is basically a rewrite of [No Straight Downgrades Melee Weapons](https://modworkshop.net/mod/35398)
  - Made with the intent of futureproofing in case Overkill changes a meta melee
  - Also makes it easier to add new melees to change the stats of

## Plans

- Maybe list all melee changes
- Maybe add options to turn on or off individual melee changes
- ...not that I would have a need for these personally
